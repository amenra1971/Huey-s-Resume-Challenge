The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career as an AWS Cloud Engineer. 
The Cloud Resume Challenge was a unique, challenging, and relevant project to add to my portfolio, host my resume, and demonstrate a variety of skills employers look for in applicants. The challenge not only requires you to build a resume programmatically, using HTML and CSS, but host that resume, integrate a database backend, connect resources serverless, and implement industry best practices through automation and infrastructure as code.
The Challenge Components includes:
1. Get Certification
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Static S3 Website
5. DNS
6. JavaScript
7. API
8. Lambda Function
9. WAF
10. Dynamodb

13. AWS CLI
14. Tests
15. Infrastructure as Code(I choosed Terraform because it was agnostic)
